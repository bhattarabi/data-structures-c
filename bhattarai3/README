* The program creates several instances of class Array and tests its
methods and overloaded operators.

* There is no input required from the user, and all output is written to the 
console.

* Tests performed for Array objects:

method					tests
----------				-----------------
constructor			*	no argument	(doesn't allocate memory. Array needs to be 
						resized before elements can be added).
					*	one int argument for Array size. index will start at 0
						--tested for exception handling in case of size argument
						being less than 0.
					*	two int arguments for Array begin and end index.
						--tested for exception handling in case of begin index 
						being greater than end index
					*	two char arguments for Array begin and end index.
						--tested for exception handling in case of begin index 
						being greater than end index
copy constructor	*	tested by passing and returning Array objects to and from	
						functions
copy assignment 	*	tested by assigning both empty and non-empty Array objects
operator
relational			*	tested for all 6 operators. the details of comparing two  
operators				array objects are provided in file array.h
index operator		*	tested for int and char arguments for exception handling in
						case of out of range aguments
Resize				*	tested for int argument for exception handling in
						case of negative integer argument
destructor			*	tested by passing Array objects to and from functions
						no memory or pointer errors were found
