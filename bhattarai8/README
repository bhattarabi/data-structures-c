* HashTable class stores a list of templated items that can be hashed. The hashing function
is passed to the HashTable's constructor to which the class maintains a public reference.
Also passed to the constructor is the maximum size of the HashTable. This HashTable implements 
linear probing to handle collisions that occur during insertion of elements. 
* Only the types that have overloaded the == operator can be stored in the HashTable.
Duplicate elements are not allowed to be stored. If for an element, the hashing function returns
a value greater than the maximum size provisioned for the hashtable, such an element cannot be stored.
* The internal representation of the hashtable is a vector of pointers to the templated
type. Pointers were used because assigning NULL to non-existant entries was deemed easier
than coming up with a dummy value that would fit all types that could be hashed.
* An instance attribute maintains the number of collisions that have occured. This can be obtained
by using the Collisions() method.

* The program creates a couple instances of class HashTable, and tests its methods.

* There is no input required from the user, and all output is written to the 
console.

* Tests performed for HashTable objects:

method					tests
----------				-----------------
constructor			*	two arguments; one int for the maximum size allowed
						a hashing function that takes a reference to the template type and returns an int
insert				*	one reference argument of the template type.
						--throws range_error if the hashtable is full, or if the hash value of the item 
						is greater than the maximum size allowed
						--throws invalid_argument exception if the item is already in the HashTable
search				*	tested both with items present in HashTable and absent
retrieve			*	tested with Symbol objects that have the same symbol and different values
Collisions			*	tested with creating a number of collision during insertion operations
